## What is the problem?

### Software is everywhere
]
.right-column[
Software is no longer just PC programs, and it has not been that for years.

- It is controlling indoor climate,

- helping you navigate in traffic,

- securing and letting you access you home and

- washing your clothes!

### Software is everywhere
### Also in critical systems
]
.right-column[
Software is even something we need to trust with our lives, as it is also being used in safety-critical sytems.

- Software is also used in space programs,

- to steer and brake cars, trains, flights,

- and to assist air traffic controllers..

### Software is everywhere

However, just as computer programs such systemst might crash or fail.

- Ariane 5 [1996] -- exploded after 37 seconds.

- Toyota Prius [2010] -- 100.000+ needed an ABS update.

- L.A. Air Route Traffic Control Center [2004] -- Lost all radio contact.

## What can we do about it?

---
.left-column[
### Formal Verification
]
.right-column[
Formal Verification is a class of techniques that can be used as to prove correctness of a system.

Each of them relies on three components:

- A formal specification of the system analysed.

- A set of formal requirements for the system.

- A mathematically-based method that can analyse the system and requirement.

### Model Checking
]
.right-column[
Model Checking is a formal verification method, that systematically will explore all possible configurations of a system model to verify that all of them meet the given requirements.

## Doesn't that solve our problems?
---

.left-column[
### Abstraction
]
.right-column[
Even simple systems can have a complex logic inside. Which makes model checking hard or impossible.

- Model Checking on a abstracted model.

- Does not prove anything for the real system.

- Model must express all details of the system.

.illustration[

???
Complexity is a major problem in model checking.
---

.left-column[
### Abstraction
### Usability
]
.right-column[
For model checking to be really helpful it should be well integrated with system development processes.

- Developing a formal system model can be time consuming.

- System specifications evolve throughout the design process.

- A design process can lead to a series of products.

### Modal Transition Systems
]
.right-column[ 
Modal Transition Systems *(MTS)* is a modelling framework that is more suited for **model-based development**, as it support **model refinement**.

MTSs are not always precise enough. They allow too many implements as *valid* implementations.
