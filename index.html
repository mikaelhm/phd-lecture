### Software is everywhere
]
.right-column[
Software is no longer just PC programs, and it has not been that for years.

- It is controlling indoor climate,

- helping you navigate in traffic,

- securing and letting you access you home and

- washing your clothes!

### Software is everywhere
### Also in critical systems
]
.right-column[
Software is even something we need to trust with our lives, as it is also being used in safety-critical sytems.

- Software is also used in space programs,

- to steer and brake cars, trains, flights,

- and to assist air traffic controllers..

However, just as computer programs such systemst might crash or fail.

- Ariane 5 [1996] -- exploded after 37 seconds.

- Toyota Prius [2010] -- 100.000+ needed an ABS update.

- L.A. Air Route Traffic Control Center [2004] -- Lost all radio contact.

## What can we do about it?

.left-column[
### Formal Verification
]
.right-column[
  Formal Verification is a class of techniques that can be used as to prove correctness of a system.

  Each of them relies on three components:

  - A formal specification of the system analysed.

  - A set of formal requirements for the system.

  - A mathematically-based method that can analyse the system and requirement.

### Formal Verification
### Model Checking
]
.right-column[
  Model Checking is a formal verification method, that systematically will explore all possible configurations of a system model to verify that all of them meet the given requirements.

## Doesn't that solve our problems?
---

.left-column[
### Abstraction
]
.right-column[
Even simple systems can have a complex logic inside. Which makes model checking hard or impossible.

 - Model Checking on a abstracted model.
 
 - Does not prove anything for the real system.

 - Model must express all details of the system.

.illustration[
  ![](images/abstraction.png)
  .abstraction-relation[
  ## $\leftrightarrow$
  ]
]
]
???
Complexity is a major problem in model checking.  
---

.left-column[
### Abstraction
### Usability
]
.right-column[
  For model checking to be really helpful it should be well integrated with system development processes.

  - Developing a formal system model can be time consuming.
  
  - System specifications evolve throughout the design process.

  - A design process can lead to a series of products.

.left-column[
  ## How does it work?
### - Markdown
]
.right-column[
A Markdown-formatted chunk of text is transformed into individual slides by JavaScript running in the browser:

```remark
# Slide 1
This is slide 1

---

# Slide 2
This is slide 2
```

.slides[
  .first[
### Slide 1
  This is slide 1
  ]
  .second[
### Slide 2
  This is slide 2
  ]
]

Regular Markdown rules apply with only a single exception:

  - A line containing three dashes constitutes a new slide
  (not a horizontal rule, `&lt;hr /&gt;`)

Have a look at the [Markdown website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) if you're not familiar with Markdown formatting.
]
---
.left-column[
  ## How does it work?
### - Markdown
### - Inside HTML
]
.right-column[
A simple HTML document is needed for hosting the styles, Markdown and the generated slides themselves:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style type="text/css">
      /* Slideshow styles */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <textarea id="source">
      <!-- Slideshow Markdown -->
    &lt;/textarea&gt;
    <script type="text/javascript" src="remark.js">
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var slideshow = remark.create();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You may download remark to have your slideshow not depend on any online resources, or reference the [latest version](https://github.com/gnab/remark/releases) online directly.

## Of course, Markdown can only go so far.
---
.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
]
.right-column[
To help out with slide layout and formatting, a few Markdown extensions have been included:

- Slide properties, for naming, styling and templating slides

- Content classes, for styling specific content

- Syntax highlighting, supporting a range of languages
]

---
.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
### - Slide properties
]
.right-column[
Initial lines containing key-value pairs are extracted as slide properties:

```remark
name: agenda
class: middle, center

# Agenda

The name of this slide is {{ name }}.
```

Slide properties serve multiple purposes:

* Naming and styling slides using properties `name` and `class`

* Using slides as templates using properties `template` and `layout`

* Expansion of `{{ property }}` expressions to property values

See the [complete list](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Slide-Properties) of slide properties.
]
---
.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
### - Slide properties
### - Content classes
]
.right-column[
Any occurences of one or more dotted CSS class names followed by square brackets are replaced with the contents of the brackets with the specified classes applied:

```remark
.footnote[.red.bold[*] Important footnote]
```

Resulting HTML extract:

```xml
<span class="footnote">
  <span class="red bold">*</span> Important footnote
</span>
```
]
---
.left-column[
  ## Markdown extensions
### - Slide properties
### - Content classes
### - Syntax Highlighting
]
.right-column[
Code blocks can be syntax highlighted by specifying a language from the set of [supported languages](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Configuration-Options#wiki-highlighting).

Using [GFM](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) fenced code blocks you can easily specify highlighting language:

.pull-left[

    ```javascript
    function add(a, b)
      return a + b
    end
    ```
]
.pull-right[

    ```ruby
    def add(a, b)
      a + b
    end
    ```
]

A number of highlighting [styles](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Configuration-Options#wiki-highlighting) are available, including several well-known themes from different editors and IDEs.

.left-column[
  ## Presenter mode
]
.right-column[
To help out with giving presentations, a presenter mode comprising the
following features is provided:

- Display of slide notes for the current slide, to help you remember
  key points

- Display of upcoming slide, to let you know what's coming

- Cloning of slideshow for viewing on extended display
]
---
.left-column[
  ## Presenter mode
### - Inline notes
]
.right-column[
Just like three dashes separate slides,
three question marks separate slide content from slide notes:

```
Slide 1 content

???

Slide 1 notes

---

Slide 2 content

???

Slide 2 notes
```

Slide notes are also treated as Markdown, and will be converted in the
same manner slide content is.

Pressing __P__ will toggle presenter mode.
]
???
Congratulations, you just toggled presenter mode!

Now press __P__ to toggle it back off.
---
.left-column[
  ## Presenter mode
### - Inline notes
### - Cloned view
]
.right-column[
Presenter mode of course makes no sense to the audience.

Creating a cloned view of your slideshow lets you:

- Move the cloned view to the extended display visible to the audience

- Put the original slideshow in presenter mode

- Navigate as usual, and the cloned view will automatically keep up with the original

Pressing __C__ will open a cloned view of the current slideshow in a new
browser window.
